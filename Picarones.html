      I always have a deep, warm feeling when I take a bite of the delicious picar√≥n. 
        Indulging in the immence flavor of the crispy, fluffy dough covered in the sweet figgy syrup take me back to the time I traveled the streets of Lima, Peru with my parents. 
        We stunbled upon a small picaroner√≠a in a small corner of the San Martin Street. 
        An old woman <em>(viejita)</em> in front of the store was laying pieces of dough in a shape of an "o" in a large oil-covered wok. 
        As we inched closer, the little pieces of dough sizzled; turning a shade darker as the minutes passed. 
        When the picarones were ready, the viejita scooped them up and then dried them on a rack. 
        Instead of asking the viejita for some "doughnuts", all I could do was salivate as others drizzled the sweet, brown syrup on their freshly fried picas. 
        Suddenly, someone tapped me on the shoulder, and as I quickly turned around, my Mom was holding a plate of six piping hot picarones. 
<br/><br />
        Sure, anyone can make picarones, but it takes skill to craft the most tasty Peruvian doughnuts. 
        For many years, my mother and I have been working in kitchen to create the ultimate picaron. 
        It all starts with sweet potatos, which we grind until it becomes a puree. 
        Once we have it in a large bowl, we add dairy milk, fresh eggs, rising yeast, and my Mom's favorite blend of spicees, which has, but not limited to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cinnamon</li>
      <li>Cloves</li>
      <li>Anise</li>
    </ul>
     <p>
         When all the ingredients are incorporated, we let it sit and rise, and then form them in a doughnut shape. 
         Just to be sure, we poke holes around the picas with toothpicks to make sure there are no air bubbles. 
         Once we here the sizzle on the oil-deep pan, we prepare the brown molasses-like syrup, which has yellow butter, light-brown sugar, and a freshly cut fig leaf. 
         After waithing countless hours for the oil to drip down the picas, it will be ours to indulge in the sweet pleasure.
